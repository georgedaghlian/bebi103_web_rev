    Analysis of microtubule catastrophe
authors: >
  Jessica Sun, Hanwen Zhang, George Daghlian

Background: >
    Gardner, Zanic, and coworkers investigated the dynamics of microtubule catastrophe, the switching of a microtubule from a growing to a shrinking state. In particular, they were interested in the time between the start of growth of a microtubule and the catastrophe event. Their goal was to have a model of the time to catastrophe.
    They monitored microtubules by using tubulin (the monomer that comprises a microtubule) that was labeled with a fluorescent marker. As a control to make sure that fluorescent labels and exposure to laser light did not affect the microtubule dynamics, they performed a similar experiment using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. They measured the time until catastrophe with labeled and unlabeled tubulin. Then they modeled it with a Gamma distribution.
    The question we want to answer is how are microtubule time to catastrophe distributed? To do this, we will investigate if a fluorescent label will affect the time of catastrophe. We will also investigate different models and compare how they work with the data. We will consider the Gamma distribution and the successive Poisson model as well. From there, we can find the perferred model for the data. We will also analyze how the time to catastrophe may change with increasing tubulin concentration.
